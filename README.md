# Diabetes Prediction System

## Overview

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction System project! This project focuses on predicting diabetes based on diagnostic measurements using data sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

## About the Dataset

The dataset consists of essential health-related features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and more. The 'Outcome' variable indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes. All instances are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

### Key Columns

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes
- Age
- Outcome (0: Not Diabetic, 1: Diabetic)

## Machine Learning Algorithm

We employed logistic regression to predict diabetes, achieving an accuracy of 74%. This model serves as a powerful tool for early identification of individuals at risk, allowing for timely intervention and personalized healthcare.

## User Interface

The project includes a user-friendly interface developed in PyCharm using Django. This interface simplifies the input of health data for prediction, making the system accessible to both healthcare professionals and individuals.

## Steps Undertaken

1. **Understanding the Dataset:**
   - Explored the dataset for structure and content.
   - Recognized the potential for predictive analysis.

2. **Variable Partitioning:**
   - Separated into independent and dependent variables.
   - Distinguished seven independent variables and 'Outcome' as dependent.

3. **Predictive Analysis:**
   - Applied predictive analysis techniques for future trend understanding.

4. **Outcome Variable Clarification:**
   - Clarified that 'Outcome' signifies diabetes presence (1) or absence (0).

5. **Machine Learning Algorithm - Logistic Regression:**
   - Implemented logistic regression for prediction.
   - Achieved a 74% accuracy in diabetes prediction.

6. **User Interface Development:**
   - Created a user-friendly interface in PyCharm using Django.

## Future Directions

- Integration of real-time health data for continuous monitoring.
- Collaboration with healthcare professionals for refinement.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the Python script.
4. Access the user interface to input health data.
